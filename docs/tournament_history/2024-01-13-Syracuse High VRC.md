# Introduction

This was our seventh competition and our second competition with our new robot.  This competition was held at Syracuse High in Syracuse, UT. There were 41 teams in attendance and that allowed there to be 7 matches for each team.

# Evaluation

We arrived at the High school around an hour and a half before the drivers' meeting would begin. This allowed us to add to our far-side autonomous so that it would score five tri-balls instead of just three.

## Qualification #3

In our first match, we were paired with 2323D. Their robot was fairly simple and all it had was a blocker. We lost autonomous but went on to win the match 75-38.

## Qualification #17

For our next match, we were allianced with 55117K. Their robot could only drive and it also had a blocker. We got the autonomous bonus and won the match 78-33.

## Qualification #30

Our next match would prove to be our hardest match of qualification matches. Our alliance partner was 1154A and their intake hadn't been working. This wasn't good because they were going to be the team that would be pushing the tri-balls into the goal. We won autonomous but ended up losing the match because we couldn't get our park off in time. The score was 60-55.

## Qualification #35

This next match we were with 1908B. Their robot had a flywheel, intake, wings, and an A-tier elevation. We won Autonomous and got the Autonomous win point. We won the match 87-34.

## Qualification #43

We got allied with one of our sister teams, 98548D. They had a puncher, intake, and wings. We lost autonomous because our alliance partner crossed the line. We still won the match 75-45.

## Qualification #60

In this match, we were with 61466B. They had an intake and a catapult. We won autonomous and got the autonomous win point and in the end, we won the match 120-72.

## Qualification #69

This was our last qualification match of the day. We were allianced with 2131Y which had a catapult, an intake, wings, and a side park that gets A-tier. We won autonomous and got the autonomous win point. We also won the match 129-24.

Alliance Selection

We ended up in third place only below 2131Y and 2131R. We knew that if those two teams allianced together then they would be hard to beat so we tried to convince 2131Y to pick us. We then had to make sure we had a backup if they decided to choose 2131R. We landed on 2131H because they had a tall blocker, an intake, an A-tier park, and a pretty decent kicker. They also had a far-side autonomous that scored five tri-balls in the goal. 2131Y ended up picking up 2131R. This meant that we picked 2131H.

## Round of 16 #5-1

This was our first elimination match and we went against 1154A and 84075C. We lost autonomous because our alliance partner crossed the line but we won the match 66-43.

## QF #3-1

In our next match, we were against 2131V and 98548D. We won autonomous and then went on to win the match 93-40.

## SF #2-1

This would be the match that would decide whether we would compete in the finals match or not. We were going against 98548H and 2131G. We won autonomous and then won the match 66-43.

## Final #1

This would be the last match of the day deciding who would go home with the tournament champion trophy and who would go home with the tournament finalist trophy. For this match we would be going against 2131Y and 2131R. Going into this match we knew it would be the hardest match of the day and it proved to be. We won autonomous but then lost the match 72-69. However, 2131Y had illegally match loaded a tri-ball so the other alliance got DQ'd. This meant we won the match.
