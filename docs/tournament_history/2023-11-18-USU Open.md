# Introduction
This was our third competition this year, It was at the USU campus in Logan. There were 26 teams there, so each team got to be a part of 7 qualifying matches.

# Evaluation
We arrived at the competition early and worked on our far-side auton and tuned our close side. We changed the close side auton so that it wouldn't cross the plane of the goal. The reason we did this is because a rule was clarified at the competition specifying that if you cross the plane of the goal you could not get the autonomous win-point.
