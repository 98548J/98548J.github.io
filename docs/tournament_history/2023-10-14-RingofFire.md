# Introduction

We participated in our first competition of the year, called Ring of Fire. The competition was held in Ely, Nevada, and we took extra care to ensure that we were fully prepared for it. We ran multiple tests and made several adjustments to our robot to ensure that we performed to the best of our abilities. Apart from trying to establish ourselves in Nevada, we also enjoyed meeting new teams and making friends.

# Alliance Selection

After the qualifications, our team was ranked third out of all the teams. This gave us an advantage in choosing our alliance partner. We knew that 98548C and 2131Y were likely to form an alliance, so we decided to approach either 89040A or 89040B. After careful consideration and debate, we decided to go with 89040A as they were a high-ranking team with a good CCWM score. They would be the perfect fit to join us in taking on the top alliance.
