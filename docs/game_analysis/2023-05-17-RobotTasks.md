# Define Problem

Before we start brainstorming specific robot mechanisms, we want to identify specific tasks within the game that the robot can perform. The tasks we outline are not necessarily tasks that will make it into our robot’s capabilities, but we want a thorough list of tasks, nonetheless. ​

# Constraints

As we are outlining tasks, the only constraints we have are outlined in the game manual. ​

It is important to remember that the game manual doesn’t tell you what you can do, rather, it only tells you what you can’t do.​

# Generate Concepts

To produce our ideas, we had a brainstorming session as a team. Here is our list of potential objectives, abilities, or tasks that our robot could potentially perform:​

* Scoring under the net.​
* De-Scoring tri-balls from under the net.​
* Moving tri-balls.​
* Launching tri-balls.​
* Holding tri-balls.​
* Receiving match loads.​
* Robot Elevation.​
* Self-Elevation.​
* Elevating an alliance partner.​
* Navigating over the barrier.​
* Navigating under the barrier.​

# Evaluate Solution

Now that we have made these criteria for this year’s game, we will be able to more effectively brainstorm robot ideas, concepts, and mechanisms.


# BRAIN STRMMMMSSSS
