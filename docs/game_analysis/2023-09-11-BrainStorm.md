# Introduction

Now that we have gone through key moments in the game we need to have a robot with mechinisums that can acomplish these tasks. Saying that we will need to brain storm and come up with concepts that we can potentually use on our robot.

# Generate Concepts 

**Catapult:** Having a catapult would give us the avaliblity to launch triballs over the central bar, and score in our alinance zone.

**Flywheel:** Among a catapult having a flywheel we would be able to launch triballs at a high valocity over the bar.

**Wings:** These will be used to descore tri-balls from the offensive zone and score them in our alliance zone by pushing them over the central bar.

**Puncher:** This mechanism would allow us to launch balls under the goal from far away rather than needing to get up close and manually push the tri ball under.

**Wheel Climbing:** By climbing up the elevation bar using wheels it could help us to score last minuet points thus possibly changing the course of the game.

**OverHang:**
This gives us a small amount of elevation points from hanging on the horizontal elevation bar.

**Intake:**
Sideways rollers that grip on to the tri balls and intake it into the robot to either a catapult or a flywheel.

# Our Dection

When considering which mechanism to use on our robot, the initial question is whether a catapult or a flywheel would be more suitable. Both serve the same purpose, but we want to choose the option that is optimal for our robot and provides the highest level of accuracy. During our decision-making process, we observed robot relays and discovered that catapults performed better than flywheels. However, we acknowledge that flywheels have more potential for improvement. As a result, we have decided to incorporate a catapult in our first robot before the Christmas rebuild. We plan to further explore the possibility of using a flywheel, but for now, we believe that the catapult is more dependable.

We plan to attach a pair of c-channel wings to our robot's sides. These wings will enable us to either push more tri-balls under the goal at once or remove tri-balls from the offensive zone.

We have decied not to use the puncher becues that limits us to scoing one Tri-ball at a time. where as we can score multipule with the wings.

In order to achieve a higher elevation in the long term, we aim to reach the maximum level on the elevation bar using a wheel climb technique. This involves using two wheels to drive up the bar. However, for the time being, we will be utilizing the overhang method, where we simply grab onto the horizontal elevation bar and pull ourselves up quickly to score last-minute points during games.

Our intake will have either sideways wheels that grip onto the tri-balls or rubber band rollers, depending on how the tri-balls are loaded.

# Summary

With this set up our robot is capable of handling various tasks efficiently. With this setup, we can complement any other robot we work with by taking over tasks that they may not be able to perform effectively. This enables us to work as a team and score as many points as possible while being proficient in skills.
