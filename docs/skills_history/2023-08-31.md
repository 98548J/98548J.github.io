# Summary
{: .design}

---
To start, skills were done with this [robot]({{site.url}}/docs/engineering/2023-06-08-ChassisPrototypeTests.html#construct). I increased my score by a total of 25 points which is equivalent to 5 more tri-balls in the goal them my previous score. This is because I had more practice with the robot.
