# Summary
{: .design}
---
To begin, these runs were done with this [robot]({{site.url}}/docs/engineering/2023-06-08-ChassisPrototypeTests.html#construct). They were also done after I had researched the rules on skills a bit more. Understanding the rules helped me realize that I could push the alliance tri-balls into the goal to the left of where I was starting. This changed my strategy a lot.
