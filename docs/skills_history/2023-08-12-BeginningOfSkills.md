# Introduction

To enhance our driving skills, we started by building a test chassis for our driver to practice on while we worked on a base chassis with a similar build. This way, our driver can get more practice without waiting too long just to drive. Our goal is to improve his skills as much as possible for competitions. If we don't win a signature competition, we hope to qualify for worlds through skills if a team has already secured their spot. Additionally, we aim to win skills at regular competitions and state if we haven't qualified for worlds by then. If the state championship is our last chance to make it to worlds if we have a high enough skills score there is also a chance the spot could come down the skills line if unfortunately, we don't win an award with a world's spot attached to it.

# Analyisis

To begin, these runs were done with this [robot]({{site.url}}/docs/engineering/2023-06-08-ChassisPrototypeTests.html#construct). They were also done after I had researched the rules on skills a bit more. Understanding the rules helped me realize that I could push the alliance triballs into the goal to the left of where I was starting. This changed my strategy a lot. Put link here for skills game analysis.
