# Summary
{: .design}

This was our second competition with our new robot. Every time we tried to run skills the programmed part that is supposed to line the robot up either wouldn't touch the bar or wouldn't point the robot in the right direction. This resulted in a 95 for our highest driver for the competition. We didn't end up running any autonomous runs at this competition because we didn't have one coded. In total, we ended with 95 for our total score.
