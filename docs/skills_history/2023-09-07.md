# Summary
{: .design}

---
During these runs, we used a catapult which changed our strategy. Instead of pushing both red alliance robots, we placed one tri-ball on the robot and one in the box to launch. As soon as the match started, we launched as many tri-balls as possible until the 15-second mark. At that point, I would drive over the barrier and push as many tri-balls as I could into the front of the goal.
