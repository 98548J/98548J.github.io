# Summary
{: .design}

---
During these runs, we used a catapult which changed our strategy. Instead of pushing both red alliance robots, we placed one triball on the robot and one in the box to launch. As soon as the match started, we launched as many triballs as possible until the 15-second mark. At that point, I would drive over the barrier and push as many triballs as I could into the front of the goal.
