# Summary
{: .design}

During these runs, we followed the same strategy as before, with only one minor change. We began by shooting as many tri-balls as possible and stopping at the 15-second mark. However, we altered our approach slightly at this point. Instead of attempting to drive over the barrier, which was difficult due to our back-heavy robot, we opted to drive underneath the red alliance pole. This allowed us more time to push tri-balls into the goal and thus score more points.
