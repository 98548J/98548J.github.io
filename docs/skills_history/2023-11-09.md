# Summary
{: .design}

These runs are the week after our home competition, and we are looking to start to get more consistently high runs. Our first driver run was a 135. This is around 20 points lower than our highest competition driver and the first time driving the robot since the competition. Our next driver was a 153. This was exactly 10 points lower than our score at the competition. We were able to get this because we had warmed up and had really good match loading and driving overall. Our last driver was a 138. This was exactly 25 points lower than our driver at the competition. On this run, we messed up on multiple tri-balls and wasted a few seconds trying to get to tri-balls that were too far away.
