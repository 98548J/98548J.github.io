# Introduction

Early in the season 229V ACE released a [reveal video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO7b-ELT21A) of their robot -- which uses a catapult/puncher combination. We noticed a lot of good things going on with their robot, but for now, we will just talk about their catapult.

# Evaluate

## Catapult -- Puncher

Below you can see images showing the layout of their catapult and puncher:

The advantage of using a layout like this is simple. You have the option to quickly launch tri-balls over for skills (via puncher), or intake into your catapult basket when you are not match loading -- or if you need to launch tri-balls at a higher arc over somebody blocking you.

# Summary 

Through watching the videos we have learned a lot so we are very grateful that we can gain inspiration and ideas in such a wonderful way. by these videos, research has been made a lot easier because of these talented minds. Along with ACE seeing multiple strategies with other teams we have learned so much from just seeing and researching through videos.
