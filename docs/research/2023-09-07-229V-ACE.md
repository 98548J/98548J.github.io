# Introduction

Early in the season 229V ACE released a [reveal video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO7b-ELT21A) of their robot -- which uses a catapult/puncher combination. We noticed a lot of good things going on with their robot, but for now, we will just talk about their catapult.

# Evaluate

## Catapult -- Puncher

Below you can see images showing the layout of their catapult and puncher:

The advantage of using a layout like this is simple. You have the option to quickly launch tri-balls over for skills (via puncher), or intake into your catapult basket when you are not match loading -- or if you need to launch tri-balls at a higher arc over somebody blocking you.

Additionally, 229V chose a very fast gear ratio to drive their catapult. (33 RPM -> 99 tri-balls per minute) A fast gear ratio allows them to spend less time launching tri-balls over the barrier, and more time scoring them in their goal.

# Summary 

227V has arranged their catapult, intake, and puncher to give them flexibility in how they can launch tri-balls.
