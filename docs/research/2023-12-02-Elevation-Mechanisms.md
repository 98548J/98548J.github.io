# Introduction

This was our fourth competition of the season and it was at St. George, Utah. There were 41 teams in attendance which led to 60 matches. This allowed each team to have 6 matches. We were one of the first teams to arrive to the competition allowing us to practice our autons and adjust anything that was needed so that they would run flawlessly.
