# Introduction

Elevation is an important part of this year's game. As such we have looked into many different ways in which to elevate our robot.

# Evaluation

There are a lot of different ways to elevate. One way is by getting caught on the middle bar and hanging. We found a video by [**229V**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGkmDeIMQyQ) That shows this technique quite well. This style of elevation is pretty useful since it doesn't require a motor and can be attached almost anywhere on a robot.

Another way to elevate is to park the robot on the lower black bars. A lot of teams use sleds to get their wheels up onto the barrier and then balance on a tri-ball, or with something else.

People have also used an arm to lift their robot up, or a wheel that attaches to the bar so they can drive up the bar. 

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTX_AHG4Rlw) video shows a way to elevate with an arm, and [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsEq6aFmkU) shows a way to elevate with a wheel.

Elevating with a wheel works by clamping the bar between two wheels and then driving up the bar.
