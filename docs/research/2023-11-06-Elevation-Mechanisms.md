# Introduction

Elevation is an important part of this year's game. As such we have looked into many different ways in which to elevate our robot. We found a video by **229V** [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGkmDeIMQyQ)

229V uses a hanger-styled approach to elevating. It is pretty useful since it doesn't require a motor and can be attached almost anywhere. 

Another way to elevate is to park the robot on the lower black bars. A lot of teams use sleds to get their wheels up onto the barrier and then they balance on a tri-ball, or with something else.
