# Introduction

Elevation is an important part of this year's game. As such we have looked into many different ways in which to elevate our robot. We found a video by **229V** [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGkmDeIMQyQ)

229V uses a hanger-styled approach to elevating. We liked this idea but, we don't have space on the robot to fit it. We chose to use ramps to push the robot up onto the barrier so that the wheels could make contact with the bar and get enough traction to drive over.
