# Introduction

Elevation is an important part of this year's game. As such we have looked into many different ways in which to elevate our robot.

# Evaluation

There are a lot of different ways to elevate. Some of the ways that we found to elevate are to hang on the elevation bar, balance, or "park" on the lower bars, or climb the vertical bar.

> ## Hanging
One way is by getting caught on the middle bar and hanging. We found a video by [**229V**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGkmDeIMQyQ) That shows this technique quite well. This style of elevation is pretty useful since it doesn't require a motor and can be attached almost anywhere on a robot.

> ## Parking
Another way to elevate is to park the robot on the lower black bars. A lot of teams use sleds to get their wheels up onto the barrier and then balance on a tri-ball. Other teams use an arm to catch on the side bar to balance.

> ## Climbing
People have also used an arm to lift their robot or a wheel that attaches to the bar to climb. 

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTX_AHG4Rlw) video shows a way to elevate with an arm, and [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avsEq6aFmkU) shows a way to elevate with a wheel.

This photo shows an idea for elevating using a wheel. The robot clamps the bar between two wheels and then drives up the bar. Team 98548H used a single wheel and used an arm to clamp onto the bar to climb. Their idea was more solid than the previous idea and less likely to break.
