# Evaluation

We were one of the first teams to arrive at the competition allowing us to practice our autons. This allowed us to adjust anything that was needed so that the autons would run flawlessly.

Qualification #7 

We were with 4691S which ended up ranking 13th and they had a half-winpoint autonomous and could push triballs with a scoop-looking pusher. We forgot to select our auton so we didn't get a winpoint but still won autonomous. We then went on to win the match 142-110.

Qualification #13 

Our alliance for this match was 89040A which ended the qualification matches ranked 2nd and had a puncher, intake, wings, and small bar so that they could hook the horizontal alliance bar and elevate for an A-tier elevation. We remembered to select the correct auton and we got the winpoint. We also won this match and the score was 166-46. 

During the remainder of the matches, we got winpoint each match, which in the end helped us stay in first.
