# Introdution

During the construction of our robot, we have frequently sought inspiration from a team. That team is 229V ACE, which has published two robot reviews since the beginning of the season. The first review is linked here, and the second is linked here. We watched and analyzed these two videos carefully and identified some incredible mechanisms that we thought would be perfect for our robot. These included their wings, intake, and how they launched their tri-balls. We took these main concepts of their robot and redesigned them for our use. As a team, we strive to only take inspiration from other robots and give credit where credit is due. We would never want to steal someone else's design, and we are grateful to 229V ACE for sharing their robot's capabilities with the community.
