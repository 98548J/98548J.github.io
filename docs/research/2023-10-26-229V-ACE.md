# Introdution

During the construction of our robot, we have frequently sought inspiration from a team. That team is 229V ACE, which has published two robot reviews since the beginning of the season. The first review is linked here, and the second is linked here. We watched and analyzed these two videos carefully and identified some incredible mechanisms that we thought would be perfect for our robot. These included their wings, intake, and how they launched their tri-balls. We took these main concepts of their robot and redesigned them for our use. As a team, we strive to only take inspiration from other robots and give credit where credit is due. We would never want to steal someone else's design, and we are grateful to 229V ACE for sharing their robot's capabilities with the community.

# Evaluate

We first looked into the catapult we ended up doing a similar catapult look but ended up using ploy tubing  to hold our robot so the top end couldn't be ridged but we liked how they had punching prongs so we took that and added except they were not connected to the catapult it self rather they are below on a screw joint.

The next thing we implemented was the wings, as a team we loved the idea of being able to push a mass amount of tri-balls into the goal. So we started to search and ACE had a great idea to reference off of we liked the design but we wanted to improve it to work on our robot and be more ridged. We use two piston instead of one so that we didn't one put so much stress on one piston because the angle it needed to push from was so steep, and tow the second could add extra force so that we could open and close faster giving us more precise movements. We also decide to use stand offs rather then a high strength axle because we found it fit better and we didn't have to modified an axle to fit in that space. 

The final thing that we referenced was the intake we thought that a double stage intake was a great idea so we  made one that would fit our robot well we used two 5.5 wat motors instead of the one full motor that they used and we only used one bracing in the middle rather then two. After building the intake we realized just how good it was for defense and for scorning.

# Summary 

Through watching the videos we have learn a lot so we are very grateful that we can gain inspiration and ideas in such a wonderful way. by these videos research has been made a lot easier because of these talented minds. Along with ACE seeing multiple strategy with other teams we have learned so much from just seeing and researching through videos.
