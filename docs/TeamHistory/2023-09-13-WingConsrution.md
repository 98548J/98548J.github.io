# Introduction 

We held our eighth team meeting today. During the previous week, we tested the catapult and made improvements to the notebook. This week, our focus is on the notebook again, as well as creating a CAD design for the next robot mechanism. We plan to add wings to the robot's sides, which will allow us to push more tri-balls into the goal and quickly remove them from the opposing team's side.

# Agenda 

## Review calendar and timeline(s) -
Currently, we have caught up on most of the notebook except for the section on testing the catapult with rubber bands and standoffs. Additionally, Thomas has begun working on the CAD for the wings on the robot's sides. We are optimistic that we will have the wings installed and the CAD completed by the end of this week.

## Tasks -
* Get Caught up on Notebook 						    (Ayla, Caleb)
* CAD Wings				   (Thomas)
* Test wings        (Thomas, Tucker)

# Summary
I am confident that our current plans will lead us to success in our upcoming competition. Our goal is to gain valuable knowledge and insights from the Ring of Fire competition, and to develop effective strategies for collaborating with both other teams and robots. It is important to remember that we are not only working with the functions of other robots, but with other people as well.
