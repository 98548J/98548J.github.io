# Introduction

We just had our twelfth team meeting of the year, and we discussed the upcoming competition that we will be leaving for on the 14th. In the two days leading up to our departure, we plan to program our robot and, most importantly, practice our interviews. We also need to pack up essential parts and tools that we will be taking with us to Nevada.
