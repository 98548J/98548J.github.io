# Introduction

Today we had our seventh team meeting of the year, and Last week, we were able to construct the catapult successfully. However, we were not able to test it due to homecoming events. This week, we plan to test it and also catch up on our notebook work. This will enable us to prepare ourselves for when we begin working on other mechanisms for the robot. We don't want to be constantly playing catch-up.

# Agenda 

## Review calendar and timeline(s) -
During the process of constructing the catapult, we discussed ways to improve our team meetings. We concluded that providing a shared itinerary for everyone to write on would enable individuals to plan accordingly. This would also assist us in keeping the meeting on track.

## Tasks -
* Get Caught up on Notebook (Ayla, Caleb)
* Build Catapult (Caleb, Thomas)
* Test Catapult	(Tucker,Thomas)
