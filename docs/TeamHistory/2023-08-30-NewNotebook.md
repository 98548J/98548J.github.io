# Introduction

Today, we had our sixth team meeting of the year to discuss our progress and plan for the future. We spent a lot of time testing the chassis, and now we are eager to move on to developing the rest of the robot. To achieve this, we plan to finish the final chassis CAD and start its construction next week. Our goal is to have the new chassis ready for the upcoming scrimmage so that we can test it in a competitive setting. After that, we will focus on prototyping the robot's mechanisms to ensure that we have a working robot for our first competition in Ely, Nevada. However, we need to use our time wisely and make sure we have enough time to code in autons and give our driver time to practice. To stay on track, we will be using the Google Calendar to set deadlines for our tasks and schedule programming and driving practice.

# Agenda

## Review calendar and timeline(s) -

Throughout the past week, our team has been conducting research and putting in effort to establish a new notebook format, while also initiating the development of a CAD for the upcoming chassis. We created a website using Github to facilitate our use of the notebook. We are confident that this new format will allow us to showcase and utilize the notebook as a tool in a more effective manner. Furthermore, we are now able to access the notebook from any device, enabling us to easily revisit our ideas and thought processes without the need for a specific computer.

Weekly Goal:  Transfer notebook into the website 

## Tasks -

* Transfer entries from old notebook to website	(Ayla, Caleb)
