# Introduction 

Today, our team had our tenth meeting of the year. We discussed the importance of cleanliness and the CAD and construction of our intake. Since we only have a little over two weeks left until our first competition, this will be the final mechanism we work on. This will give us enough time to program and drive, ensuring that we are well-prepared to put our best foot forward.
