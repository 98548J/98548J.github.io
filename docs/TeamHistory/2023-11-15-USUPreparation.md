# Introduction 

We had our seventeenth team meeting this week, we discussed our upcoming competition at a local college called Utah State University. After our last competition, we realized that we could have performed better during skills. Hence, we focused on having our driver practice more and refining our skills in autonomous mode. Our aim is to maximize our points scored during skills.

# Agenda 

## Review calendar and timeline(s) -

Last week, we came up with a plan to enhance our notebook, enabling us to move closer to excellence. We aim to use the notebook as a tool rather than just a log that we have to continuously catch up on. Over all implementing this has given us a goal to work toward.

# Summary

We believe that by putting a lot of effort into improving our skills, we can increase our score by 30 to 50 points. While practicing skills this also helped us practice maneuvers for matches which will ultimately lead us to perform better overall. At the USU competition, we are confident that we will perform much better and hopefully come away with an award.
