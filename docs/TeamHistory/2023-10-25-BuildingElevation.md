# Introduction

We had our fourteenth team meeting this week and will begin working on the CAD for our home competition's elevation. Adding this elevation will help us maintain our good qualification rankings and give us an advantage in case something goes wrong during a match. With the ability to elevate, we hope to turn the tides of any game in our favor.

# Agenda 

## Review calendar and timeline(s) -

Last week, our goal was to add more images and information to our notebook, and start building a prototype of an elevation machine. We also did some research to get inspiration, and one of the sources we looked at was 229V ACE. You can find a research entry about them in our notebook. We were abel to add a lot of the pictures and information however before the notebook is due for our competition we want it to be as clear cut as possible.

## Tasks -

* Pictures in notebook	    (Caleb, Ayla)
* General Notebook   (Ayla, Caleb)
* Prototype Elevation/CAD   (Thomas)

# Summary

By dedicating more time to practicing and improving our notebook and robot, we will perform well in the upcoming competition. Additionally, as this is our home competition, it holds a great deal of significance for us, and we aim to do our best and achieve the highest possible results.
