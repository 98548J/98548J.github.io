# Introduction

We just had our eleventh team meeting of the year, and it's the last full week before our first competition. With the competition fast approaching, there are many things that need to be polished so that our robot can be in peak condition. We not only want to improve the robot, but also our communication skills, such as interviews and strategies with other alliances.

Last week we were able to completely CAD and construct our intake it has been working quite well along with a minor catapult adjustment. We did this so the tri-ball wouldn't be pulled in as far if we were just goal loading the goal.

## Tasks -

* Program autonomous 			    (Caleb)
* Skills			   (Tucker)
