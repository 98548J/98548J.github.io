# Define Problem

Last year, we failed to qualify for worlds, so we held a meeting to brainstorm some strategies to make it this year. To qualify for worlds, a team can receive an award at state such as design, excellence, or torment champion, win first prize in certain online challenges, or win an award at a signature event such as excellence, or torment champion

# Generate Concepts

## Here are the three main pathways to Vex Worlds that we found -

Online challenges:

* Promotion video
* Girl Power
* Theme it up
* Cad engineering 
* Career readiness 
* Reverse engineering 
* Mathworks follow the path

State Championship:

* winning state championship 
* excellence 
* design

Signature Events:

* Winning the championship
* excellence

# Develop Solution

Our top choices for the online challenges were [Girl Power](https://challenges.robotevents.com/challenge/205/vrc-high-school-girl-powered-challenge-sponsored-by-google), [Career Readiness](https://challenges.robotevents.com/challenge/187/vrc-high-school-career-readiness-challenge), [CAD Engineering](https://challenges.robotevents.com/challenge/197/vrc-high-school-cad-engineering-challenge-sponsored-by-autodesk), and [Math Works Follow the Path](https://challenges.robotevents.com/challenge/217/MathWorks_FollowThePath). Doing these challenges will give us a fallback in case we don't qualify for worlds through traditional means.

Our goal is to qualify at state or a signature event by achieving an excellence award, torment champion, or design. To achieve this, we will meticulously document everything we do in our notebook using the design process. We will prioritize giving our driver more time to practice and improve their skills score, as well as dedicating more time to programming our autons to help us score win points and increase our qualifications ranking. Additionally, we will work on developing strategies for different types of robots to ensure we are fully prepared for each match.

Some signature events we are partaking in are, (Rumble in the Rockies) UT, (Pikes Peak) CO. These are the two signature events we guaranteed going to but there are a few others we are thinking about such as, (Haunted) TN, (Silicon Valley)CA, (Hollywood Blockbuster) CA.

# Summary

The effect of our team preparing multiple pathways to worlds increases our chances of qualifying. Also, winning awards at any of these competitions enhances our team's reputation and increases our likelihood of being selected higher on the waiting list, in case other options fall through.
