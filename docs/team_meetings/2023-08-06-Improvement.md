# Introduction

During our previous team meeting, we were able to complete our assigned tasks and successfully and test the chassis. This week, we intend to design a catapult using CAD software to launch tri-balls over the central bar at the beginning of the match or during autonomous mode.

# Agenda 

## Review calendar and timeline(s) -
Last week, we fell behind on the notebook while testing and adjusting. So, we plan to catch up and improve it in the next two weeks.

## Tasks -
* CAD Catapult	(Caleb)
* Transfer pictures 						    (Ayla)

# Summary
Overall, I believe that this week we can be extremely productive by focusing on creating a notebook and constructing our first catapult. This catapult will provide us with a significant advantage in gaining points at the start of each match. Therefore, it is crucial that we have a well-made one.
