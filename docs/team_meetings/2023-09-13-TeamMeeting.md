# Introduction
We successfully built the catapult last week, but due to homecoming events, we were unable to test it. This week, we plan to test it and catch up on our notebook work. Additionally, we aim to start designing and building the wings using CAD software.

# Agenda 

## Review calendar and timeline(s) -
During the process of constructing the catapult, we discussed ways to improve our team meetings. We concluded that providing a shared itinerary for everyone to write on would enable individuals to plan accordingly. This would also assist us in keeping the meeting on track.

## Tasks -
* CAD Wings	(Thomas)
* Notebook 						    (Ayla, Caleb)
* Build wings					    (Caleb, Thomas)
* Test Catapult							   (Tucker,Thomas)
* Test wings (Tucker, Thomas)
