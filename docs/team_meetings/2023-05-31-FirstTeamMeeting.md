# Introduction

Today, our team held its first meeting to plan for the upcoming week. Using the agenda template we made in the last entry, we reviewed our goals, tasks, and schedules for each team member. This approach allows us to collaborate effectively even when we are not physically present together.

To help keep track of everyone's tasks, we have assigned a color-coded sticky note to each team member. Caleb has pink, Tucker has blue, Ayla has green, and yellow represents everyone. We can then sort these notes into three categories on the whiteboard: pending, in progress, or completed. This allows us to easily track the status of each task.

As we are not starting construction for another week, we are dedicating our attention to our notebook.

Caleb is responsible for completing the game analysis and the odometry section, while Ayla is in charge of the team meeting entries.

Regarding the other tasks, we will collaborate as a team. At the moment, we are in the process of deciding a date for our team photo. Furthermore, we will review the notable signature events in our region that we intend to take part in this year.
