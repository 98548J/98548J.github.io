Define Problem

We currently have no experience with odometry. One thing I (Caleb) want to do this year is use odometry to program our autonomously. However, It would be very helpful if we had a robot to start programming odometry with.

The problem is that we don't have a robot to do this with.

Generate Concepts

Here are some potential solutions we came up with for this ‘testbed’:

* Integrate it into our competition robot.
* Build a simple testbed robot separately.

Our Decision

Since we have not finished our game analysis yet, it wouldn’t make sense to integrate odometry into our competition robot yet. As such, we decided to design a simple robot with odometry tracking wheels instead.

Develop Solution

In order to speed up the process of building our designs, we use CAD software before we build. The CAD software we use is Autodesk Fusion 360. One convenient thing about Fusion 360 is that it stores all of your files online, this way each team member can almost seamlessly work on the same file, from different computers.
