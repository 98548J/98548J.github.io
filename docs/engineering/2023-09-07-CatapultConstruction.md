 # Define Problem

Prior to our initial competition, we recognized the necessity of a launching mechanism in order to maintain a competitive edge. Numerous concepts exist for launching a flywheel or a catapult. Considering the time constraints and the level of accuracy required, we opted for a catapult as we are confident we can achieve optimal performance with superior precision. 

{: .problem}
We need a catapult to preform sufficiently in a match.

# Develop Solution

To began we will CAD our design for our catapult including the gear box and the head. Where as Caleb and thomas have great experience in CAD they will be taking over CAD for the catapult. After CAD Caleb will be constructing and attaching the catapult to our chassis.

 # Construction 

 When starting construction we made s lip gear by using a dermal to grind off some of the teeth so when the gear would get to the gap the tension on the catapult would send it flying forward at a high velocity then in turn launching the the tri-ball. After that we made a gear casing for the slip gear to sit in along with its counter part to move it in the first place. We didn't want the gear box to high so we decided that nine holes was tall enough. WIth it being that tall it will also put the catapult it self in the correct place for launching.  Our catapult head consists of horizontal standoffs that give the catapult central support for launching there are a set of outer and inner stand offs to make sure the tri-ball launches at the correct time and not to early or to late. We also plan to tests the catapult for the right tension and for the right length of stand off.
