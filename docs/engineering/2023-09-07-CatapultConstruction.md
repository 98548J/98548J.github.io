 # Define Problem

Prior to our initial competition, we recognized the necessity of a launching mechanism in order to maintain a competitive edge. Numerous concepts exist for launching a flywheel or a catapult. Considering the time constraints and the level of accuracy required, we opted for a catapult as we are confident we can achieve optimal performance with superior precision. 

{: .problem}
We need a catapult to preform sufficiently in a match.

# Generate concepts 
There are two main ideas as stated on the intro a fly wheel or a catapult here are the advantages and disadvantages of both.

Flywheel: By using a flywheel, we can launch tri-balls at incredibly high rates due to the ability to adjust the RPM of a flexible wheel. This could potentially allow for scoring from the other side of the field due to the immense force behind it. However, achieving consistency with the flywheel can be quite challenging.

Catapult: Using a catapult allows us to launch tri-balls with great accuracy, consistently placing them in the desired area. This strategy makes it easier for us to push the balls under the goal, resulting in a significant increase in our points per-second. However, it's important to note that the use of rubber bands is required, and over time, the rubber bands may wear out, potentially leading to decreased accuracy.

# Develop Solution

We had a small meeting to discuss whether or not we should use a flywheel for our project. The group ultimately decided on a catapult due to its accuracy and ability to score points quickly. Additionally, it was relatively easy to program and build.

{: .decision}
Making a catapult will benefit us more over all because of the grouping and reliability.

# Develop Solution

To began we will CAD our design for our catapult including the gear box and the head. Where as Caleb and thomas have great experience in CAD they will be taking over CAD for the catapult. After CAD Caleb will be constructing and attaching the catapult to our chassis.
