# Introduction 

Prior to our initial competition, we recognized the necessity of a launching mechanism in order to maintain a competitive edge. Numerous concepts exist for launching a flywheel or a catapult. Considering the time constraints and the level of accuracy required, we opted for a catapult as we are confident we can achieve optimal performance with superior precision.

Some things we are looking for in a catapult

* 99 tri-balls per minute

 * Acuate 

* Correct tri-ball positioning

# Construction 

When starting construction we made s lip gear by using a dermal to grind off some of the teeth so when the gear would get to the gap the tension on the catapult would send it flying forward at a high velocity then in turn launching the the tri-ball. After that we made a gear casing for the slip gear to sit in along with its counter part to move it in the first place. We didn't want the gear box to high so we decided that nine holes was tall enough. WIth it being that tall it will also put the catapult it self in the correct place for launching.  Our catapult head consists of horizontal standoffs that give the catapult central support for launching there are a set of outer and inner stand offs to make sure the tri-ball launches at the correct time and not to early or to late. We also plan to tests the catapult for the right tension and for the right length of stand off.
