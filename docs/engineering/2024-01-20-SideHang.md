# Define Problem

After constructing our initial hang, we noticed that it was becoming increasingly difficult to use as time went on. Therefore, we decided to build a guaranteed side hang that would be quick and reliable, allowing us to secure an A tire park at the very least. This would be a significant advantage for us during the end game since the side hang would take less time than the horizontal hang, enabling us to focus on scoring points instead of worrying about hanging with only 30 seconds left.

{: .problem}
We need a quick side elevation so that we can work on scoring more points end game.

# Generate Concepts

When observing other robots, it becomes clear that there are three main methods for performing a side park. These include muscle up, caching, and balancing. Heavier robots tend to use the muscle up method because it's harder for them to catch themselves or maintain balance. This method involves lifting the back of the robot off the ground so it's not in contact with the floor tiles. Caching, on the other hand, involves using a side wing or hook to catch the elevation bar before the robot falls. Finally, balancing involves using a tri-ball or the shape of the drive train to maintain balance on the ground elevation bar.

{: .decision} 
After some deliberation we decided to use a passive hook hang because we already have an elevated catapult and it would be just a small addition.
