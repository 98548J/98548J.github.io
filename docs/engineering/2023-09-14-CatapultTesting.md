# Introduction 

We have successfully built our first catapult and are now ready to begin testing it. We plan to conduct multiple tests, including Rubber **Band Intensity** and **Standoff Length**, To determine the necessary amount of rubber bands and length of standoffs, we need to conduct tests. These tests will provide valuable information on whether we need to reconstruct the head of the catapult.

# Generate Concepts 

**Band Intensity:** We plan to conduct a series of tests to determine the optimal number of rubber bands required to launch the tri-ball to the desired distance, ensuring it lands in the offensive zone consistently. Initially, we will place an equal number of rubber bands on both sides of the catapult and then add one extra on the other side to achieve the precise tension needed for the catapult.

**Standoff Lengths:** To ensure optimal launch accuracy, we will first measure band intensity and then proceed to testing the length of stand-offs. This is crucial in preventing the tri-balls from launching too early or hitting the ground. We will conduct tests with and without the middle stand-offs to determine if additional support is necessary, resulting in the best possible launch outcome.

# Testing

Initially we began with the rubber band test and we did 14 tests each time we switched the rubber bands we latched the catapult ten times after launching them ten times we gave them a percentage from zero to one hundred and given a color based off it. As is demonstrated in the graph below.

In the graph it demonstrate the number of tests the amount of rubber bands on each side of the catapult and the score parentage it got
| Rubber-Band Amount |
| Test | Right Side | Left Side | Score |
|:--:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 2 | 2 | 100% |
| 1 | 3 | 3 | 100% | 
| 1 | 4 | 4 | 100% |
| 1 | 5 | 5 | 100% |
| 1 | 6 | 6 | 100% |
| 1 | 7 | 7 | 100% |
| 1 | 8 | 8 | 100% |
