Define Problem

In our previous entry, we detailed how we designed, built, and tested 7 different drivetrains. The purpose of these tests was to figure out what the best wheel layout for our drivetrain would be. The results of our tests are shown in this entry.

{: .problem}
We need to decide exactly which wheel configuration we will use, the speed of the chassis, and the size footprint of our drivetrain.

Generate Concepts

Here are some potential solutions we came up with, all of these concepts were based on our testing data.

## Wheel Configurations -

1. A drivetrain with 6 4” wheels.
2. A drivetrain with 4 4” wheels and small flex wheels in the middle.
3. A drivetrain with 4 3.25” wheels and small flex wheels in the middle.

## Chassis Width / Lengths -

1. A large chassis. (35 holes in each dimension)
2. A skinny chassis. (25 holes wide, 35 holes long)
3. A wide chassis. (25 holes long, 28 holes wide) 

## Chassis speeds -

1. A very fast chassis ***(~62 inches per second)***
   * 200 Rpm Motors -> 72 Tooth Gear -> 48** Tooth Gear -> 4.0" Wheels
2. A fast chassis ***(~61 inches per second)***
   * 600 Rpm Motors -> 36 Tooth Gear -> 60 Tooth Gear -> 3.25" Wheels
3. An average speed chassis ***(~56 inches per second)***
   * 200 Rpm Motors -> 60 Tooth Gear -> 36 Tooth Gear -> 3.25" Wheels
4. A slower chassis ***(~51 inches per second)***
   * 600 Rpm Motors -> 36 Tooth Gear -> 72 Tooth Gear -> 3.25"

Construct & Test

Now that we have finished the CAD of our base chassis, we will build it according to the CAD. That way, there will be as few mistakes as possible, and because the CAD is so detailed, we won't need to figure out spacing when we build it. This method also keeps the chassis square and causes the least friction. Untimely leading to a more successful drive train.

With the help of the CAD, we were able to construct the chassis in only a few hours. The chassis is very smooth-running and has almost no friction. Using CAD allowed us to work out any problems with the chassis we had beforehand which saved so much time in the end. 

There was one thing that differed from the CAD on the chassis was instead of a screw joint on the wheel, we changed it to a regular axle so that it would move smoother. The screw joint was causing friction, and changing it eliminated all the friction. 

We plan to test the new chassis in our club scrimmage on Thursday. That way, we can compare our drive train to others and then reevaluate to see if there are any adjustments we can consider. However, with all the testing and CAD work we have done, I don't see much that we could adjust other than making a cover for the gears that contact the bar slightly. 

Along with the scrimmage, we ran the same tests on this chassis as we did on the previous test chassis. Below are the results of the scrimmage and tests we ran.
