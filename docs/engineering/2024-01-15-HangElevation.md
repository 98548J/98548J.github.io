# Define Problem

When considering elevation in our strategy, we aimed for at least an A tier because it can quickly turn the game in our favor. We have witnessed numerous matches where teams have won by simply parking their robot. Additionally, having a reliable parking mechanism allows us to team up with a robot that has an opposite parking mechanism, enabling us to execute a double park on the elevation bar similar to the Tipping Point game from the previous year.

We need an elevation mechanism to help us in the end game of a match.
