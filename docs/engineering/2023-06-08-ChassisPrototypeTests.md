Define Problem

This season presents our robots with a unique challenge; there is a (non-trivially tall) barrier spanning the field:

![barrier](/assets/engineering/Barrier.png)

Because our team has never encountered such a (literal) obstacle before, we don't know what the most effective method of traversing such an obstacle would be.

{: .problem}
We need to find out what features make a good chassis for this season.

{: .design}
Generate Concepts

Here are some potential ways we could solve our problem:

1. Design, build, and test multiple chassis, each with unique characteristics.
2. Look on VEX forum and YouTube for any robots already built that perform well.
3. Make our best educated-guesses about what kind of characteristics will perform the best on a chassis, and start building.

Our Decision

We are all in agreement that the last concept (#3) is a poor choice. And while option #2 would probably work, we wouldn't know **why** the chassis we built is good.

{: .decision}
The option that would allow us to learn the most, is option #1. (Also, this solution would adhere to the design process).

{: .design}
Develop Solution

First, we will install Fusion 360 on our personal computers and create a shared folder for easy access to all team members. However, the robotics room will be closed from June 16 to August 1, which means that we will have to halt production of the robot until we can meet as a team again. In the meantime, we will focus on completing the chassis so that we can have a quick start when we resume working together.

Ayla and Caleb are experienced with Fusion and will handle most of the CAD work. They'll use a downloadable parts file library to avoid fabricating every piece used on the robot; instead of spending time creating CAD files for individual parts, we can create assemblies using pre-made CAD files. During the break, Ayla also plans to start CAD work on other subsystems of the robot after the chassis has been completed.

Once we are done designing a chassis in CAD, we will build and test it.

{: .note}
For our seven different chassis designs, we first made a CAD model of **a single small robot** with four 4‚Äù wheels, over time we realized that it would be **much easier** to make **a modular chassis** that could be easily adapted for other test modes by switching out wheels. The adjustable chassis was designed with 6 modes in mind. See the below images:

The images depicted above show the seven chassis that we will be testing. We plan to gather data on both designs and incorporate the best features into another CAD model.

Construct & Test

We started building the first of our seven CAD chassis today. Our aim is to test them and determine their strengths and weaknesses through our testing. This will help us identify the features that work well and those that don't.

Our testing procedure involves multiple runs over the center bar to determine its success rate. We will document each instance of success and failure, along with the reason for any failures.

After completing construction, we will move on to testing the functionality of each drivetrain to evaluate how well it performs during game tasks. Here are some pictures showing the first drivetrain, and the first test mode of the adjustable chassis:
