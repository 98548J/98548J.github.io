Define Problem

This season presents our robots with a unique challenge; there is a (non-trivially tall) barrier spanning the field.

Because our team has never encountered such a (literal) obstacle before, we don't know what the most effective method of traversing such an obstacle would be.

{: .problem}
We need to find out what features make a good chassis for this season.

{: .design}
Generate Concepts

Here are some potential ways we could solve our problem:

1. Design, build, and test multiple chassis, each with unique characteristics.
2. Look on VEX forum and YouTube for any robots already built that perform well.
3. Make our best-educated guesses about what kind of characteristics will perform the best on a chassis, and start building.

{: .design}
Our Decision

We are all in agreement that the last concept (#3) is a poor choice. And while option #2 would probably work, we wouldn't know **why** the chassis we built is good.

{: .decision}
The option that would allow us to learn the most, is option #1. (Also, this solution would adhere to the design process).
