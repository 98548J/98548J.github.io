# Define problem 

During our matches, we discovered that to play defensively, we needed an intake mechanism that would allow us to launch tri-balls over the central bar. This would enable us to counter the match loading of the opposing team. The intake would also allow a second way to score other than pushing them in with our wings.

We need an intake so we can better play the game and do more defensive strategies

# Generate Concepts

There are two main ways to create an intake system: a single-stage and a double-stage. The double-stage system is more effective as it can easily intake and remove tri-balls from the robot. It is also much more accurate when it comes to scoring in the goal. On the other hand, a one-stage intake system needs to be larger to accommodate tri-balls and is more difficult to operate if a tri-ball gets stuck inside.

# Our Decision

We ultimately decided to go with a double-stage intake because of accuracy and it is a lot easier to use.

### Objective --

Our objective is to build a two-stage intake that can intake the tri-balls from any angle with a good grip.

# Develop Solution 

During the process of designing our intake system, we decided to use two sets of sprockets so we could use the gaps and place rubber bands in them. This allows us to grip the tri-balls more effectively as we intake them. Moreover, the rubber bands are not rigid, which gives us the flexibility to pick up the tri-balls from any position they may be in.

# Construction

During the construction of our intake mechanism, we're using two sets of sprockets - one larger, and one smaller. This is because the larger sprocket must sit lower, while the smaller one, which is placed towards the inside, must sit higher. This is important because the catapult is higher than the ground, and if the sprockets are not positioned correctly, the intake mechanism will jam constantly. 

While building the intake, we noticed that it would be pretty flimsy if we used stand-offs. So, we decided to create a gearbox and use c-channel to hold it. We want our intake to be light, but we don't want to compromise on its durability. 

During the construction process, we realized that we didn't want the intake to be rigid. Hence, we designed it in such a way that when pressure is applied, it can move back and forth like a door. This design ensures that when we push tri-balls into the goal, the intake mechanism itself doesn't stop us from scoring.

# Testing

Once we finished constructing our robot, we planned to perform a series of tests. These included in-taking tri-balls from a corner, in-taking them from the central bar, and out-taking them while a tri-ball was inside the robot. During these tests, we will randomly position the tri-balls to ensure the accuracy of our results.

## Results 

| | Corner Intake| Central Bar Intake | Inside Robot |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Corner down | 100% | 100% | 100% |
|  Flat side on the ground  | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Thrown/ Random | 100% | 100% | 100% |

After conducting tests, we realized that our intake is quite versatile and hard to jam. It can intake a tri-ball from any position with ease.
