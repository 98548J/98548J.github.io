# Define problem 

During our matches, we discovered that in order to play defensively, we needed an intake mechanism that would allow us to launch tri-balls over the central bar. This would enable us to counter the match loading of the opposing team. The intake would also allow a second way to score other than pushing them in with our wings.

We need an intake so we can better play the game and do more defensive strategies

# Generate Concepts

There are two main ways to create an intake system: a single-stage and a double-stage. The double-stage system is more effective as it can easily intake and remove tri-balls from the robot. It is also much more accurate when it comes to scoring in the goal. On the other hand, a one-stage intake system needs to be larger to accommodate tri-balls and is more difficult to operate if a tri-ball gets stuck inside.

# Our Decision

We ultimately decide to go with a double stage intake because of accuracy and it is a lot easier to use.
