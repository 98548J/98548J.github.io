# Define problem 

After constructing and testing our first catapult, we have come to the realization that it needs to be significantly faster in order to be effective in matches and skills. Therefore, we will be rebuilding the catapult with the goal of launching 99 tri-balls per minute. This will allow us to quickly launch all 44 match loads during skills, enabling us to perform other game actions without delay.

{: .problem}
We need a better catapult that can fire at a faster rate

# Generate Concepts

We have limited options as our first competition is in two weeks and we need to not only program but let our driver. Here are our current ideas for the short amount of time we have.

* leaving the catapult as it is. This will allow us to focus on other mechanisms and programming, as well as give our driver more practice time. However, it is important to keep in mind that this may leave us with less time to rebuild the catapult before our next competition after our first. Additionally, using an inefficient catapult may affect our driver's performance as he got used to the old one.

* Rebuilding now, this could lead to less time for our driver to drive along with less time on other mechanisms
